# Challenge-Two
## Description
In this project we were given the assignment to create a personal portfolio that when it loads has a working nav bar, our name, and a photo or avatar. I decided to do more of an abstract design and use a photo cutout of myself then use the header and h1 tag to present my name over my avatar. We were to have an about me section, a section with our previous works, and a contact me. I decided to impliment some javascript in my index head to make the nav bar operate the way I wanted it to.
